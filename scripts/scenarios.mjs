// Practice conversations for Nudgy's intent-spotting, taken from real cases that went wrong or felt off.
// Each turn is what the user says plus what we expect Nudgy to pick up. The runner replays them against
// /api/extract, carrying the chat history and reminder list between turns, like the app does.
//
// expect keys (all optional):
//   tasks: n                   exactly n NEW reminders
//   taskIncludes: ['word']     a new reminder mentions each word
//   actions: ['update']        these action types appear (done, delete, update, snooze)
//   actionOn: ['mum']          the non-update actions hit a reminder mentioning these words
//   due: { word: 'YYYY-MM-DD'} the reminder mentioning word ends up due that day (new or updated)
//   repeats: { word: 2 }       the reminder mentioning word repeats with that many time slots
//   asks: true | false         Nudgy asks a follow-up question (or not)
//   proof: { word: true|false } the reminder mentioning word does (or doesn't) need a photo
//   mood: 'overwhelmed'

// "Now" for every scenario: a Tuesday, so Nov 3 is Tue, Nov 4 is Wed, Nov 5 is Thu.
